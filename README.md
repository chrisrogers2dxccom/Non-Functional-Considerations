| How do I engage a client in a Non Functional Requirements dialogue ? | When engaging in a client dialogue around Non Functional Capabilities it is recommended to start with a dialogue around Commercial and Value for Money considerations, then move to a discussion around Information criticality and Security.Progressing from this to a dialogue about Access then helps crystallize the system,it's modules and likely disposition. Having established the 'coarse grain' parts of the system the dialogue can progress to examine the Business Criticality of each system module and what it's key capabilities need to be to support the associated Business processes and drivers. Following that a dialogue around Capacity and Responsiveness enable us to finesse the capabilities associated with Performance and system responsiveness.Finally a dialogue around the ecological capabilities of the system allow us to establish any overarching principles around efficiency, recycling and reuse. Throughout the dialogue one needs to be prepared to go back and alter previous assumptions and cascade the impact through ones mental model before arriving at a statement of capabilities that are driven directly by business needs for the scope of the system under consideration. | Key11:Commercial\|Key12:Information\|Key13:Access\|Key14:Business Criticality\|Key15:Capacity\|Key16:Performance and Responsiveness\|Key17:Ecological |
| How do I discuss Commercial considerations ?                 | What kind of system does the client envisage and what is their cost envelope for the development ? Typical aspirations are for a 'unique and bespoke' system at commodity prices. Clearly there is a need to provide value for money however if the dialogue revolves around very high security, availability and very low data loss then many commodity platforms and cloud services will not be usable. This is an opportunity for an honest and early discussion around affordability and maybe developing a just 'good enough' prototype to prove the concepts and test the needs for higher Non Functional capabilities | Key21:High Security\|Key22:Very High Availability\|Key23:High Fault Tolerance\|Key24:Highly Distributed\|Key25:'real time'\|Key26: Extended Transactions\|Key27: Zero Data Loss\|Key28:100% Disaster Recovery capability |
| How do I discuss Information considerations ?                | The life blood of any IS/IT system is the Information it contains, the security and sensitivity of that information cascade down to a multitude of lower level Non Functional Capabilities. Sovereignty over the information may restrict the countries it may be processed in ( or be allowed to even flow through ). The Region and Industry will bring with it legislative and compliance mandates that impact the Information processing regime. The client will always be responsible for managing the risk of information loss or disclosure and may need help to assess that risk.  The people that may handle data ( even for support functions ) may be restricted and there may be specific classification ratings associated with disparate sets of the information that affect how it can be processed and where. In aggregate information may also attract a higher compliance and audit capability. Information handling of course is not solely about security and confidentiality, the client dialogue also needs to address the currency of the information ( how up to date it appears and 'transactions' ), the integrity of the information ( how we protect in transit and prove the information hasn't been corrupted or tampered with during processing ), the audit capabilities around change or deletion of information data and the length of time information has to be retained by the system. All these issues affect the complexity and cost of a system. The dialogue should start on the assumption that the information is 'Commercial' grade and minimal information protection is required and be lead to more complex capabilities from client direction rather than being offered as an IT capability. | Key31:Encryption\|Key32: Data Classification\|Key33: Network Access\|Key34: Audit\|Key35: Timestamps\|Key36 RPO\|Key37:Backup Frequency\|Key38:Data Integrity\|Key39:Code Integrity |
| How do I discuss Access considerations ?                     | To further refine the Non Functional Capabilities discuss the way the Information in the system needs to be processed and accessed. Who needs to access it ? Where are they located ? What Jurisdiction do they operate it ? What is the physical environment they access from? What devices will they use ? In the dialogue you can buildup ( or refine ) your view of the 'modularity' of the system, what information is processed together, where and how is it processed ( the topology and topography of the system ), where are the system 'modules' likely to reside ( given the previous dialogue around the Information sensitivity ) ? From and Access perspective what Authentication, Authorisation and Audit capabilities are required for each user group in each location. The dialogue should again start with a low common denominator and be driven more complex by proven business need. In the development of a prototype or MVP of course only a subset of users and locations may be involved and care must be taken to not prematurely 'over engineer' solutions and over specify capabilities | Key41:Login\|Key42:Access Permissions\|Key43:Passwords\|Key44: Inactivity\|Key45:Operational Hours\|Key46:Maintenance downtime\|Key47:Ops Locations\|Key48:Usability\|Key49: Presentation\|Key50:Particular Needs |
| How do I discuss Business Criticality considerations ?       | To further understand the capabilities of each module in the system we need to understand the significance of it's loss to the Business, for example an order fulfillment module may be decoupled from an order capture module and the Business availability of each may be different. We should look to define the least restrictive and cost capability unless there is evident business need for something more rigorous, discuss the business process around the system module, what are the upstream and downstream dependencies, how long could the business continue to operate without the module, are there any times when this flexibility changes ( e.g. peak times of the year ), are there other significant but maybe indirect dependencies for the loss of a module ? You will discuss : Availability, when the system must be available and operational: Recoverability , how long the module and system can take to recover upon failure: Contingency/Continuity , what alternative means might allow the business to continue to operate: Maintainability,how much time can the system be down for critical and essential maintenance. Remember that IT systems degrade very quickly and technical debt is more difficult to resole the longer it is extant so maintainability is key to a 'healthy and secure' system and ultimately reduces the risk of unplanned outages and increases availability. | Key51:System Types\|Key52:Automation\|Key53:Upgrade\|Key54: Change Control\|Key55:Reliability\|Key56:MTTR\|Key57:MTBF\|Key58:RTO\|Key59:Robustness to Change |
| How do I discuss Capacity considerations ?                   | Introduce discussions around capacity to the dialogue, how does the business expect users to exploit the system and it's modules, will there be a gradual ramp up of usage or a large day one volume ? What sort of activity will be undertaken and during which hours of the day ? Will there be peaks and troughs of processing activity over time, during the day, week or month ? These discussions progress naturally to dialogue around volumes of interactions, system throughput and ultimately processing and storage capacity of the system.  These aspects have always been important in systems design however with the advent of cloud services the 'peaks and troughs' of processing can be dealt with much more efficiently and cost effectively than with traditional bespoke designs. In the realms of data storage it's important to take account of data retention capabilities and factor in any data movement costs. Don't forget the capacity required to development and test environments. | Key61:Transactional Throughput\|Key62:Storage Capacity       |
| How do I discuss Responsiveness considerations ?             | A critical success factor for any system is how it is received and perceived by end users. If the system fits well with their ways of working and expectations then probability of success are higher.  Discuss in detail how users will engage with the system and use it, do they expect instantaneous responses, can the interface be capture now and process later ? Are there data consistency requirements that mean ACID Transactions are necessary ( e.g. debit / credit as part of an atomic transaction ). These discussions lead to an understanding of the business needs of transactions, response times and ultimately the interconnectivity between modules and the processing time within modules | Key71:Response Times\|Key72:Processing Times\|Key73:Interoperability |
| How do I discuss Ecological considerations ?                 | Finally, many clients and corporations have advanced ecology policies as part of their strategy or even 'culture'. Discuss how sensitive the client is to these needs - are they paramount and take precedence over e.g. short term cost. Discuss any needs to understand the 'Green credentials' of systems and services, 'carbon footprints', Energy Efficiency, Recycling and Reuse. | Key81:Equipment and Service efficiency\|Key82:Partner and Vendor Green credentials |

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| What is a High Security system ?                       | High Security systems may demand restricted locations, accredited staff, high ( and expensive ) levels of encryption, authentication, authorisation and audit. This is especially significant in Government, Military and Intelligence clients but may also appear in Financial services and of course legislation like  GDPR affects all individuals data for EU citizens | Key12:Information\|Key13:Access               |
| What is Very High Availability, High Fault Tolerance ? | Very High Availability and zero data loss is frequently only obtainable with bespoke hardware platforms, whilst many cloud services are highly reliable they frequently quote 99.5% availability - which could result in 10s of hours of outage a year. 99.99% availability by comparison tends to increae cost exponentially ( Mainframe Platforms and 'dual system' Non stop Platforms ) | Key12:Information\|Key14:Business Criticality |
| What is a Highly Distributed System ?                  | Many systems are highly distributed to provide resilience to for example network failure or site disaster. Some systems may also be distributed to segregate processing - for example capture of data in one location but processing in another. The interconnections and reliability of connections between distributed elements is key to achieving the objectives of the dispersal | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What are Real time systems ?                           | 'real time system' are really the realm of Operational technology ( OT ) and control systems - indicating that the time taken between the system receiving a stimulus and responding is in nano seconds. The term is sometimes ( mis ) used now to indicate that systems have a fast response time ( in milli seconds ) | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What are Extended transactions ?                       | In distributed systems it is possible to extend the scope of a transaction over multiple processing nodes ( even from disparate vendors and products ), XA transactions and 2 phase commits were in vogue at one time, today the preference is to avoid these where possible as the compensating transactions and heuristics can become complex where 5 or 6 resource managers are involved | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Zero Data Loss ?                               | On failure of a system data that has not been persisted to some permanent media ( disc or persistent memory ) may be lost - designers can go to significant lengths to reduce the possibility and extent of this data loss - sending data to multiple end points, replicating in real time between disc arrays etc. Sometimes it's more important to consider the consistency of the recovered data - is the logical consistency ( from say the database commits ) consistent with the physical consistency ( from the disc cache commits ) - many products have complex configurations of cluster software and transaction logs to try to ensure consistency of recovery | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is 100% Disaster Recovery capability ?            | Often clients will specify sufficient capacity for 100% of the user base to be able to use the system should a major failure or disaster occur. Frequently this results in huge waste of resource as the system is sized to 200% or more. In reality many businesses can operate in some 'degraded mode'of 30-50% capacity | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Encryption ?                                   | Information may need to be encrypted at rest and in transit. At rest the encryption may be achieved through hardware or software ( the storage media or fabric can provide encryption or the database OS may provide encryption ). In transit the data may need to be sent over encrypted channels again this can be hardware enabled whereby the data is converted by a hardware device or sent over a channel that is encrypted like a VPN or TLS circuit | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Data Classification ?                          | Information may be 'classified' by a client in different ways and a handling policy associated with each classification defining for example it's access and encryption needs. In many Government, Intelligence and Military clients this is a formal classification and information is also 'marked' with it's classification. In these cases the data classification is a very serious concern and risks of loss and compromise resulting in danger to the nation state and life | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Network Access ?                               | To access information systems end user need some network access point, historically these have been within the corporate network, however increasingly these access points are wireless or from open networks in insecure environments (home, coffee shop), these access points need to be considered in the round and the security risks and countermeasures considered | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Audit ?                                        | There is little point authenticating and authorising access to systems without providing some audit trail. The extent of the audit trail itself and who may access it is frequently subject to separate rules and providing integrity guarantees of audit data via e.g. digitally signing and checksums is common | Key12:Information                             |
| What are Timestamps ?                                  | In addition to 'transactional' integrity some systems need to allow data to be accumulated across multiple interactions with a user. In the case of conflict for access to the underlying data some timestamp may be required to ensure rollback of incomplete and conflicting transactions. Timestamps are of course applied to many data records and it's critical that the times source of stamps is consistent across a systems. Many systems source time from network devices and network service providers | Key12:Information                             |
| What is RPO ?                                          | Recovery Point Objective - the measure of acceptable data loss on system failure - e.g. RPO of 15 minutes means that up to 15 minutes of data loss is acceptable | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Backup Frequency ?                             | The frequency that system backups are taken. Backups can be complex, many systems provide data transaction streams ( for recovery ) that are themselves backed up or replicated for security. Additionally database management systems may provide DB backups and disc systems may provide disc or file backup.  The RPO and the Disaster Recovery capabilities of the system all impact on the Backup regime. Don't forget to consider transient files and queues in any backup and recovery considerations. Note Backup and Archive are different things | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Data Integrity ?                               | As information moves around our system how do we ensure that  what we dispatch is actually what is received ? how do we ensure that data elements that are related are actually updated consistently with each other ? Data integrity has a large span of applicability but some of the major areas include : Transactionality - the scope of commit and rollback units, confidentiality of data in transit and preventing 'man in the middle' attacks, integrity of data on recovery..... | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Code Integrity ?                               | In traditional systems development much of the code development was bespoke and products that were used could be managed through Definitive Service Libraries ( DSL ) and Configuration and Release management. Many systems had simple code control mechanism restricting how code could be updated or introduced to a system or preventing the introduction of alien code. With the introduction of more 'OpenSource' code to systems consideration needs to be given to verifying the source of the code and ensuring it's integrity before introducing to any system. | Key12:Information                             |
| What is Login ?                                        | A system user needs to authenticate ( and frequently authorise ) themselves for access to a system and it's functions. The login may be seamless and use credentials from external systems as well as internal systems ( e.g. Azure active directory ). The source of credentials and their scope and confidentiality is critical to ensuring a systems security - breach of the credential authority means every login is suspect. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What are Access Permissions ?                          | When users or systems access the functions or data in a target system they present a set of access permissions. These are sometimes based on Open Standards and sometimes are proprietary to the platform or operating environment. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What are Passwords ?                                   | Users or systems present Passwords to access a systems functions or data - Password complexity should be commensurate with the information being protected and passwords need to be protected both at rest and in transit through encryption. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What is Inactivity ?                                   | When users or systems access a system function or data the duration of the session and it's context can lock both resources and provide a window for compromise of the system security. It is good practice to provide inactivity timeouts for both User and system interactions to force frequent authentication and authorisation. Obviously there needs to be consideration of the balance between security/performance and usability. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What are Operational Hours ?                           | Traditionally many systems were designed to support operational hours when users were 'in the office' and designed to allow volume / exclusive batch processing 'out of hours'. With more globalised access many systems these days are available 'around the clock' and system design has to cater for concurrent transactional and batch activity. This dichotomy is resolved either by making all interactions 'transactional/row processing' ( i.e. no exclusive batch ) or copying data for exclusive batch or set based processing. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What is Maintenance Downtime ?                         | The health of a system is heavily impacted by the currency of it's software and often the physical organisation of information, every system needs exclusive downtime for software upgrade, patching, and data reorganisations. It is easier to build these kinds of capabilities now with various Cloud services however the capability still needs to form part of the system design and the Operational design of the systems management. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What is Ops Location ?                                 | With Global companies operations staff may be located in many timezones and regional locations to provide necessary system support and maintenance. Information security needs may restrict the locations these services can be provided from. Obviously restricted locations often increase the commercial costs of systems. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What is Usability ?                                    | The success or failure of a system is often related to it's perceived 'usability', is the User Interface design helpful, is the response time as expected, does the system interleave well with the business function it supports, User Experience and Design Thinking are critical to develop a system that is considered highly usable. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What is Presentation ?                                 | How information and functions are presented to users ( be they humans or systems ) is critical. Simple things like device screen resolution may make a system unusable. The JSON format of a message may be poorly or well thought out from a consumer perspective. Give due consideration to Presentation and how the 'user' interacts with the system. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What are Particular Needs ?                            | People with disabilities also need to interact with IS/ IT systems, this may be good design practice or contractually binding. People may have audio, visual or manual disabilities. Special interface design techniques and practices are needed to ensure a usable system, frequently elements are tailored to individuals. Care should be taken to understand the capabilities in this areas and the commercial and system design implications. | Key13:Access                                  |
| What are System Types ?                                | There are many different kinds of IS/IT system - with many having unique characteristics, however there are emergent common themes around system types that enable us to try to assign a 'range of capabilities' to that system type. For example some systems are 'business critical', some 'developer systems', some 'operational support systems'. Categorisation of system types allows us to simplify the constraints and assumptions around system behaviour and drive standardisation to some degree and commercial benefits of this commoditisation. It can prove a useful discussion point in the client dialogue as to the real criticality of the system or module. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Automation ?                                   | Automation is a wide topic area, many software applications are essentially 'automated' functions. In modern systems designs automation is paired with active intelligence and AI to remove human interaction. This is particularly useful in systems operation and maintenance where laborious and often ignored tasks can be automated to improve system reliability. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Upgrade ?                                      | Systems need frequent ( sometimes continual ) upgrade. The upgrade may be due to a new software release or patching of software for some feature or bug fix. With increasingly agile developments it can be quite normal to have to deal with daily or weekly upgrades to system capabilities. The upgrade mechanisms needed, whilst continuing to provide 'live service' need to be designed in or appropriate downtime agreed with the client. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Change Control ?                               | The robustness of a system is frequently related to the robustness of the change control mechanisms. Change Control doesn't mean 'obstruction' - many DevSecOps oriented systems have good change control whilst still providing agility. Give consideration to change control frequency and authority in the design and get a good balance between speed and control in change control and release management. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Reliability ?                                  | Reliability of a system is a measure of 'when it's available when you need it', some systems seem to be very resilient to change others 'fragile' and prone to interruption when upgraded or changed.  When systems are fragile it is usually because they have not been designed properly for operations or are being pushed beyond their design limits in terms of performance or capacity. This is especially critical in moving from a 'pilot or prototype' to a business critical production system - there may be 'redesign' required - don't assume pilots and prototypes will 'scale to operations' even if scalability for capacity and performance is linear. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is MMTR ?                                         | Mean Time To Recover - the mean average of the time it takes to recover a module or system from a failure to a usable condition. This can be complex to calculate or predict with a system with large numbers of disparate modules and elements. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is MTBF ?                                         | Mean Time Between Failures - how frequently a module or system fails and the average time between those failures occurring. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is RTO ?                                          | Recovery Time Objective - the target time it takes to recover the system from a failure to a usable system. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Robustness to Change ?                         | Change can introduce instability, the more 'loosely coupled' and modular a system is the more robust it is to change. The downside of course is then the complexity of the interactions. Modularity and isolation of change is a good design goal to limit change impacts. | Key14:Business Criticality                    |
| What is Transactional Throughput ?                     | How much 'work' a system can deal with is a complex topic area depending not just on the speed of comms, processor speed, instruction set and application code but also the data access latency and contention. Typically systems can be designed for a certain target transactional throughput e.g. 100 messages / transactions a second. Probably more important is to design the system so that it's scalability characteristics are understood - e.g. adding another app server gives us 50 tps more up to 20 app servers then we need to add another DB cluster node. Overloading a system usually results in long response times or failures in the interaction, it is often better to build in throttling of the requests to prevent overload hence work that does get through is protected and likely to succeed. | Key15:Capacity                                |
| What is Storage Capacity ?                             | Storage capacity includes storage required with different access characteristics and properties. For example high speed storage ( Solid state disc ) may be required for DB caches or file caches, medium performance for general storage - a lot of storage is solid state these days and so incredibly fast - but don't waste high performance storage where not needed - examine the characteristics of the storage and use most appropriate to the job if there are cost and commercial implications. With pilots and prototypes use good enough storage and leave complex specialisation as the system is refactored to become operationally robust. | Key15:Capacity                                |
| What is Response Times ?                               | The response time of a system is the time taken from the input stimulus being sent to the completion of the response e.g. from pressing send on a screen to the response screen finishing building, or from the submission of a message to receiving the completed response. Care needs to be taken about where response time is measured - for example if a system uses the 'internet' to provide user access then there may be no control over the speed of that as a service integrator. Similarly where other services are used they may not offer guaranteed response times and committing to punitive ones may not be within your ability to 'fix'. In system design try to avoid multiple tightly coupled interoperability and focus on providing a good rapid user response time. Patterns like Capture now process later, or 'callback' can be useful to mitigate complex interactions. | Key16:Performance and Responsiveness          |
| What is Processing Times ?                             | The time it takes to process a request ( depends again on where you measure from and to ), typically the overall response time of a system is an aggregate ( sequence or parallel ) of sub operations and processes. In highly distributed and dispersed systems it may be minutes, hours or days to process a complex function. | Key16:Performance and Responsiveness          |
| What is Interoperability ?                             | In highly modular and distributed systems the interoperability and interaction between elements is crucial to both responsiveness and also failure points, the more interoperations the more fail points. Design usually addresses these fail points by ensuring that multiple paths and resources are available to cater for failure and that the mode of interoperability enables disconnection and reconnection to resources. The ease of interoperability depends to some extent on the ease and simplicity of the mechanism which is why 'web services' and REST'ful interfaces are the predominant interconnection today, replacing more complex connection protocols. Interoperability is aided by 'dumb pipes' and 'smart endpoints'. | Key16:Performance and Responsiveness          |
| What is Equipment and Service efficiency ?             | All IT services ( even those of cloud providers ) consume energy and produce waste, many hardware platforms are engineered to provide high energy efficiency and the DataCentre environments are designed for energy efficiency. If bespoke developments are planned and workload is very stochastic then systems that manage power efficiently are worth investigating and designing for.The nature of Cloud services and their 'burst capacity' frequently circumvents such considerations today and it's the choice of provider and their green credentials that are primary. | Key17:Ecological                              |
| What are Partner and Vendor Green credentials ?        | Many IT supplier of services and product are passionate about minimising the ecological impact of their services and invest heavily in doing so. It is worth taking time to understand the modules in a system and the green credentials of the products and services they are based on as part of the clients overall ecological strategy. Some clients may make the green agenda a primary criteria in partner, vendor and product selection and this is worthy of detailed discussion as early as possible. | Key17:Ecological                              |
